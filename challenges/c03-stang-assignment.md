*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    starts_with("E") | starts_with("nu"),
    values_drop_na = TRUE,
  ) %>% 
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>% 
  filter(E > 0)

df_stang_long
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
df_stang_long %>% summary
```

    ##      thick            alloy               angle          E

    ##  Mean   :0.3212  
    ##  3rd Qu.:0.3277  
    ##  Max.   :0.3310

``` r
df_stang_long %>% distinct(alloy)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   alloy  
    ##   <chr>  
    ## 1 al_24st

``` r
df_stang_long %>% distinct(angle)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 1
    ##   angle
    ##   <int>
    ## 1     0
    ## 2    45
    ## 3    90

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - E ranges from 9900 to 10700, while nu reanges from 0.3100 to 0.3310.
    While it’s not one universal value for each category, it is a pretty
    small range.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - There’s only one type since the alloy type for all data points is
    al_24st.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, and 90
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.05322, 0.08100
- My own question:
  - What is the relationship between angle and nu?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here

df_stang_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = angle, y = nu, group = angle)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Angle (degrees)") +
  ylab("Poisson's Ratio") +
  ggtitle("Poisson's Ratio vs. Dogbone Angle")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- There doesn’t seem to be a strong correlation between the angle and
  nu. The 45 degree angle has the highest average nu, followed by 0
  degress, then 90 degrees.
- The 45 degree angle has higher nu values in general compared to the
  other two angles (including 25th and 75th quartiles).
- The 75th quartile for angles 0 and 90 seem the relatively the same,
  though the 90 degree angle has a lower 25th quartile and lower mean
  nu.
- Apparently, maximum shear stress occurs at 45 degrees. This is
  reflected in the boxplot above.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> “A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
> of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
> amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("E (ksi)") +
  ggtitle("Young's Modulus vs. nu with thicknesses")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph supports the contradicts the claim above. Upon closer
    evaluation, the thickness of 0.081 consistently has the lowest
    average E values while 0.022 has the highest average E values. There
    seems positive correlation between the thickness and E, although
    there are not a lot of data points which makes the correlation weak.
  - The nu values for different thickness seem a bit more varied.
    Although the 0.081 thickness has the lowest average nu values, the
    average nu values are more scattered for the other three
    thicknesses.
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - The evidence seems relatively conclusive for the relationship
    between thickness and E. Just based off the E averages of each of
    the thicknesses, we can see a positive correlation between thickness
    and E. However, the evidence doesn’t seem that conclusive for the
    relationship between nu and thickness, so more data points are
    needed for that to see if there is actually a pattern.
