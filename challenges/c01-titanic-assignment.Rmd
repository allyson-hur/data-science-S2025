*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Effort | Some task **q**'s left unattempted | All task **q**'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
df_titanic %>% glimpse
```

**Observations**:

-   There are 5 columns:

    -   Class

    -   Sex

    -   Age

    -   Survived

    -   n

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

**Observations**:

-   Write your observations here
-   Are there any differences?
    -   According to the Wikipedia page, there were around 2,224 passengers and crew aboard. There are 2,201 people accounted for in the dataset.
-   If yes, what might account for those differences?
    -   The 23 people that weren't accounted for might've cancelled their trip before boarding the Titanic. Additionally, apparently some passengers traveled under aliases, and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists. The dataset might've taken into account some of those aliases.
    -   ...

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

**Observations**:

-   The majority of survivors were crew, with 1st class as a close second.
-   Each class had more female survivors except for the crew. It's unclear whether this is because there were more male crew than female crew on the ship.
-   2nd class had the least number of survivors, with the majority being female.
-   Since we're only looking at the survivors, it's difficult to tell why 2nd class had the least number of survivors. Perhaps that class was the smallest?

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

```{r q4-task}
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") 
```

**Observations**:

-   Write your observations here.
-   Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
    -   Most people, if not everyone, in the 1st and 2nd classes survived
    -   A lot more females survived compared to males in both the 3rd and crew classes
    -   3rd class had the lowest proportion of survivors.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```         
```

```{r}
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(~Age)
```

**Observations**:

-   The addition of age makes the graph a lot more detailed. While all the 1st and 2nd class children survived, that is not the case for the adults. So, in fact, not everyone in the 1st and 2nd classes survived.
-   There's still a higher proportion of female survivors compared to male survivors for each class.
-   When the ship was sinking, people most likely prioritized saving women and children.
-   If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain the fishy-ness.
    -   The plot in q4 doesn't contain information about the age, which turns out to be an significant factor for the survivors. The plot for q4 implies that everyone in 1st and 2nd class survived, whereas in q5 it's revealed that while all 1st and 2nd class children survived, this is not true for 1st and 2nd class adults.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
